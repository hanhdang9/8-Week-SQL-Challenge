### Context

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

**3. How many customers are allocated to each region?**

````sql
SELECT
	region_name,
	COUNT(distinct customer_id) cus_num
FROM 
	customer_nodes c
	JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1;

**4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?**

- Firstly we create reallocation table with a lag column that shows every customer's previous start date. Then we calculate the different between periods by taking start_date column minus lag column, located in "different" column.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reallocation;
CREATE TEMP TABLE reallocation AS(
	SELECT
		customer_id,
		region_id,
		node_id,
		start_date,
		LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date),
		start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS different
	FROM customer_nodes
);
````
-- We can easily see the average number of days that customers are reallocated to a different node is the average of "different"

````sql
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(different),0) avg_rellocation_days
FROM
	reallocation;
````
- Or we could also use this way:

````sql
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(end_date - start_date + 1), 0) avg_rellocation_days 
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31';
````

*Answer:*

| **avg_rellocation_days** |
| ------------------------ |
| 16                       |
***
**5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?**

````sql
SELECT
	region_id,
	PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY different) AS median,
	PERCENTILE_DISC(0.8) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY different) AS percentile_80,
	PERCENTILE_DISC(0.95) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY different) AS percentile_95
FROM
	reallocation
GROUP BY region_id;
````

*Answer:*

| **region_id** | **median** | **percentile_80** | **percentile_95** |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **1**         | 16         | 24                | 29                |
| **2**         | 16         | 24                | 29                |
| **3**         | 16         | 25                | 29                |
| **4**         | 16         | 24                | 29                |
| **5**         | 16         | 25                | 29                |

#### B. Customer Transactions

**1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?**

````sql
SELECT
	txn_type,
	COUNT(*) txn_count,
	SUM(txn_amount) total_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1;
````

*Answer:*

| **txn_type**   | **txn_count** | **total_amount** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **purchase**   | 1617          | 806537           |
| **withdrawal** | 1580          | 793003           |

***
**2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?**

````sql
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(total_deposit_count),2) avg_deposit_count,
	ROUND(AVG(total_deposit_amount),2) avg_deposit_amount
FROM
	(
		SELECT
			customer_id,
			COUNT(*) total_deposit_count,
			SUM(txn_amount) total_deposit_amount
		FROM customer_transactions
		WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
		GROUP BY 1
		ORDER BY 1
	) AS sub
````

*Answer:*

| **avg_deposit_count** | **avg_deposit_amount** |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **5.34**              | 2718.34                |
***
**3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?**

````sql
WITH 
	cte AS(
		SELECT
			*,
			CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END deposit,
			CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END purchase,
			CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END withdrawal
		FROM customer_transactions
		),
	cte1 AS(
		SELECT
			TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'Month') month_name,
			customer_id,
			SUM(deposit) deposit_count,
			SUM(purchase) purchase_count,
			SUM(withdrawal) withdrawal_count
		FROM cte
		GROUP BY 1,2
		)
SELECT
	month_name,
	COUNT(customer_id) customer_count
FROM cte1
WHERE deposit_count > 1 AND (purchase_count = 1 OR withdrawal_count = 1)
GROUP BY 1;
````

*Answer:*

| **month_name** | **customer_count** |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| **April**      | 50                 |
| **February**   | 108                |

| **March**      | 113                |
***
**4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?**

````sql
-- Step 1: Create a fix_amount column which define 'deposit' is adding amount, 'purchase' and 'withdrawal' are subtracting amount.

WITH sub AS(
	SELECT
		*,
		CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE 0 - txn_amount END AS fix_amount
	FROM customer_transactions
	)

-- Step 2: use window function to sum over the fix_amount column, partition by customer_id and the month of txn_date

SELECT DISTINCT
	customer_id,
	DATE_PART('month', txn_date) end_of_month,
	SUM(fix_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date)) closing_balance
FROM sub
ORDER BY 1,2;
````
