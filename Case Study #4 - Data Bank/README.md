### Context

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

### Questions and Answers
#### A. Customer Nodes Exploration

**1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

````sql
SET search_path = data_bank;
SELECT
	COUNT(distinct (node_id, region_id)) node_num
FROM customer_nodes;
````

*Answer:*

| **node_num** |
| ------------ |
| 25           |
***
**2. What is the number of nodes per region?**

````sql
SELECT 
	region_name,
	COUNT(distinct node_id) node_num
FROM 
	customer_nodes c
	JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1;
````

*Answer:*

| **region_name** | **node_num** |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Africa**      | 5            |
| **America**     | 5            |
| **Asia**        | 5            |
| **Australia**   | 5            |
| **Europe**      | 5            |
***
**3. How many customers are allocated to each region?**

````sql
SELECT
	region_name,
	COUNT(distinct customer_id) cus_num
FROM 
	customer_nodes c
	JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY 1;
````

*Answer:*

| **region_name** | **cus_num** |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **Africa**      | 102         |
| **America**     | 105         |
| **Asia**        | 95          |
| **Australia**   | 110         |
| **Europe**      | 88          |
***
**4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?**

````sql
-- Firstly we create reallocation table with a lag column that shows every customer's previous start date. Then we calculate the different between periods by taking start_date column minus lag column, located in "different" column.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reallocation;
CREATE TEMP TABLE reallocation AS(
	SELECT
		customer_id,
		region_id,
		node_id,
		start_date,
		LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date),
		start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS different
	FROM customer_nodes
);
SELECT * FROM reallocation
-- We can easily see the average number of days that customers are reallocated to a different node is the average of "different"
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(different),0) avg_rellocation_days
FROM
	reallocation;
````
- Or we could also use this way:
````sql
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(end_date - start_date + 1), 0) avg_rellocation_days 
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31';
````
